7122486,"Magnificent champagne made with Pinot noir, p meunier and Chardonnay. Blend of 11 vintages and more then 100 cuves, I cannot say it is strongly ""something"" driven. In the contrary, it is more the archetype of a NV champagne. The only defect I could find was the size of the bottle. "
7122486,"3000 A special bottle to mark the milestone. Krug ID 112008, bottled winter 2011, 134 wines blended from 12 vintages, 1990 to 2005. Med lemon w. fine bubbles.

It is a blend of 140 different wines from 13 different years between 1998 and 2010, all in all 45% Pinot Noir, 39% Chardonnay and 16% Pinot Meunier.

7122486,"This is heaven! A champagne from the top shelve. Very mature complex scent and taste. Compaired to other champagnes this is in another class. Full, mature, dense, delicate. So many notes, I don't know where to begin. Marcipan, nougat, chocolate is just a start. It's sweet and dry at the same time. Just delicious!"
7122486,"Whenever I try Krug I am always blown away by the depth and complexity of this wine, with a length that seems to go on forever. This wine was comprised of an extraordinary number of different wines from vintages dating back thirty years. That they do this for their non vintage wine is part of the reason the Krug brand has reached this level of quality and recognition."
7122486,"This is how we ended the night. My first Krug and all I can say is its a game changer. The best champagne  Ive had in my life thus far  Krug ID 412043 A blend of 134 (!!!) wines dating back to 1990 (!!) with the youngest from 2005 Toasted bread, white flowers, almonds, brioche, honey, crisp apple, lemon curd, DAMN!!  Exceptional"
7122486,"Christmas  at a bakery. Its full glory unravels with 30 minutes of aeriation. Multi-layered and an opulence of aromatics in perfect harmony with the precise and intens flavour profile.  That tertiairy and oxidative spectacle of brioche, hazelnut, sweet caramel and toffee aromas seamlessly integrate with those lemon and apricot flavours.  Beautiful acidity structure and immens lenght and depth. How it is meant to be! Somm told me that the latest editions show more finesse and harmony. Blows me away!"

1141123,"A fantastic French Champagne!  Clean, crisp and bubbly! Great flavours of ripe bosco pear, green apple with a hint of pink grapefruit. Worth every cent and worth a solid 4.8..."
1141123,"The most consistent, reasonably priced true champagne for the last 200 years. I love this one.  Had an 04 Cristal tonight and this was comparable. For hundreds of dollars cheaper this is the choice.  Thanks Russian oligarchs and American rappers for ruining the price of great champagne."
1141123,"Light yellow on the eye. Dry and fresh, a bit of earthy undertones on the nose at first. Apples, citrus and vanilla on the palate. Well balanced, really enjoyed it. Nice aperitif, totaly my cup (glass) of tea (champagne)."

1248038,A lovely wine! First flavor that hits you is a moderately big cherry flavor. Very smooth taste. Finish is mild with hints of licorice. I had it with a pasta bolognese and it was perfect with it.
1248038,"Very good easy drinking Montepulciano . Well balanced high, vibrant acidity. Simple, but yummy candied red cherry  and red currant flavours. Not very long but tasty finish.  Enjoyed a glass at Lupo Restaurant in Vancouver and it is a great value for the price.  Will definitely reorder."
1248038,"The nose is big and bold, with rowdy berry fruit that never shies away or breaks up. Soft tannins create a soft finish as it ends with a blast of raspberry flavor. Just right for big parties and events. Very refreshing and easy to drink combined with a great price. Very good product ! Big cheers everyone!"
1248038,"This vineyard seems to produce consistently very good wines. This might not be one of them but its good. Dark cherry colour with light opening yet noticeable nose. Flavours of black berry, blueberry, dark cherry, black currant and a little earthy plus smokey scent. Quite drinkable. (3.7)"
1248038,"3.8  sounds about right. Smooth cherry notes and a very easy drinking bottle. At $12, can't beat the value either."
1248038,"Available in a 1.5L! This is a cheap, utterly enjoyable wine. Perfect for parties. Great with food, or just to sip."
1248038,Great summer time red. Amazing value.
1248038,3.7. Light wine. Some fruit. Good for fish
1248038,"Medium to full bodied. More tannins than the usual Montepulciano d'abruzzo. Dry, acidic. Bargain."
1248038,"Fruity, easy, and great for its price!"
9119,"Red fruits (cherry?), cigar box, vanilla, leather used saddle), wet earth and pencil shavings. Delicious and an excellent value (EUR 25). Cheers!"
9119,"88/100 6 years in old barrels Red plum red cherry oxidative as nuts and walnut old wet wood chestnut hint of mint dried cherry Med body High acidity Med soft tannins Med alcohol Pronounced intensity Long finish This winery produce constantly outstanding wines, with incredible ageing potential. This has 12 years old and is still far from his peak of quality that probably will be in 5 to 7 years! Splendid"
9119,"First bolder red of the fall, killer on day 2. Leather and violets dusty mineral tannins. Whats not to love 10/10 drink any cold night."
9119,"Typical Rioja! Dry start which mellows but with a distinct acid. Good length and body. Prunes, cherries and oak. A very good choice."
9119,"What a wine!! So many levels of flavor! Bay leave, pepper, vanilla, blackberry, violet, cigar leaf, black fruits, oak. Wonderful! Love it!"
9119,"Earthy, woody, dusty, with a great balance of dark fruit and oak, just as you should expect from a Rioja like this. Great execution."
9119,"Best Rioja ive ever had. Leather, ripe red fruits, medium acidity, surprising smooth mouthfeel. Had it a few years back, but it has aged very well."
9119,"Oaky, more fruity and bold than the 2002 vintage (tasted in the same session). Whilst it is great to drink now, I guess it will be even better later."
9119,"Absolutely superb Rioja, beautiful dark berry fruit, soft in the mouth, hint of fungus and herb. Bargain at 7 Portes in Barcelona"
9119,"Delicious, leather, vanilla and oak and a warming finish, brick red colour and smooth. Cracking match with a rich tomato sauce dish."
1194720,red fruit on the nose..stewed cherry along with wet earth / wood and vanilla. Delicious pinot. A bit acidic with a kick. Bright
1194720,"Ruby hue, big red cherry nose, opens with watery cranberry and cream, middle is simple, finish carries rose-hips, mild clove and earth. Simple QPR Pinot."
1194720,"Nice color, more transparent red emerald in color. Low viscosity. Black cherry on the nose. Black cherry on the palate and almost a bit of generic curry spices. Reminds me more of an Oregon pinot."
1194720,"Not too shabby. A quaffable Cali and Canadian blend of Pinot noir grapes. Paired with pulled pork and pork rinds. Awesome pairing! Notes of cherry, blackberry, licorice, mint, spice and flowers."
1194720,"Nose of cherry, vanilla, rose pedals and hay, palate of dark red cherry and raspberry, white pepper, oak and a whisper of clove, soft, round tannins, medium finish. Nice QPR."
1194720,Great wine for some good fish at home. Lots of fresh red berries with some vainilla undertones. Long finish and totally approachable.
1194720,"Considering the climate changes and regions, some pinot noir wines from California taste like Oregon Pinot noir. It could be because the winemakers harvest grapes before they fully ripen or they just buy grapes from Oregon and bottle it in California."
1194720,Cherry and strawberry but I wouldnt call it fruit forward. Medium tannins. Not my favorite but drinkable.
1194720,Great wine. cherry earthy oak blackberry black cherry
1194720,"Really nice, lots of fruit, not very acidic. Some blackberry and cherry."
1578948,"Great Nebbiolo. Chocolate covered cherry, white pepper, anise, red plum, violet, leather, minerals. Still developing but still great now. 8.5/10"
1578948,"Typical Nebbiolo, earthly tones and a bit closed in the beginning. But really opens up after a while and offers a nice elegant combination of dark fruits and pepper"
1578948,Incredible!!!  Very elegant with a beautiful finish.  Scents of leather cherry tobacco on the nose and also on the palate.  A well rounded earthy vino 
1578948,"Love this. Elegant floral perfume, rose petals, red cherry, pomegranate, cranberry. High tannins but not as strong as Barolo. High acid. Drinking beautifully now."
1578948,"Woof. Who needs barolo when you have gattinara like this! Very perfumed, floral nose. Sliced meats. Tomato chutney. High intensity. Nice acidity. Beautiful finish. Reminds me a bit of Parusso."
1578948,"Very nice and elegant Nebbiolo. Cherry, leather and oak on the palate. Dry snd acidic with rounded tannins. Needs air. Complex, and quite bold with a lovely earthy finish."
1578948,Fantastic Nebiolo. Cherry and strawberry on the nose. Very smooth and refined tannins. Just a hint of bitterness at the finish. Paired very well with a spicy red sauce with shellfish.
1578948,Just loving these Gattinaras. Leather and oak finish. The 16 vintage had lots of red fruit on the nose. Some really good minerals with a nice tobacco note through the length 
1578948,"Moderately rich and round, this red boasts cherry, white pepper, earth and light underbrush flavors. Balanced, this lingers with a tangy hint of peppery greens. Drink from 2022"
1578948,I tried 2015 vintage. The moderate fragrance and attack could be good pairing with tomato based dish like trippa and stewed beef. I like the wine. leather earthy mushroom balsamic truffle cherry red fruit raspberry red currant oak cedar clove licorice pepper cinnamon violet rose petal rose hip tomato
3069,"Great wine. I almost feel guilty drinking this without my friend, Andy.  Almost. But hell....it's my birthday week. Screw you Andy. V"
3069,"Perfect balance between taste, scent and touch. A carbenet so perfect that makes you wanna experience it more and more. Congratulations Silver Oaks!"
3069,Just got this wine from a vendor. They have wines at different price points and theyre all good but Ill happily drink this one. :-)
3069,Now drinking this beautiful bottle in 2020. We are social distancing. Happy birthday sister! 55!   so soft yet complex mouth. Love it!! USA proud. God bless us all.
3069,"Very bold, mouth full but needs to wait in the bottle quite a lot to fully reach its potential. Red fruit coats the mouth hints of vanilla, dominated by tobacco, mocha and long lingering finish."
3069,"Whoa!! I was blown away by this selection. I shared the bottle with my guy at the birthday dinner he took me to to celebrate. Very memorable all around!! Deep red fruit, leather, rich finish."
3069,"Double Wow!! This amazing crimson purpleish wine just threw me out the front door. The nose was so full of smoke, chocolate and dark cherry. The smooth black currant and vanilla just melted in my mouth. The finish was such velvetness I couldnt get enough. Bravo!"
3069,"4.8/5 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley 2014 Amazing Cabernet. The oak, vanilla, musk and earthy on the nose. But its amazingly crisp and dry on the palate. Strong fresh vanilla, prunes and earthy notes on the tongue. Its got delicious tannins. And a Long Long lasting finish. One of the best Ive tried!"
3069,"Good Lord this was fantastic. I dont normally believe in Cabernet Sav as a concept.  Generally horribly overvalued as compared to the wall of wines that exist. Smooth black cherry, light oak, and clean clean clean taste. Would blow the money again for this any day."
3069,Nice charred cedar nose. Start is wet with some effervescent and a hint of pipe tobacco smoke. There is some nice black cherry in the middle and it get a little spicier through the finish. Delicious.
1153696,"Leather and earthy nose. Soft tannins, with plum and dark fruit flavours. Full bodied. Can drink on its own or with heavier meals."
1153696,"Tasting no 5. Open nose with notes of cherry, vanilla, rounded earthy notes. Soft well balanced palate with loads of flavour and lenghty ending."
1153696,I love this wine and it's such a great bargain. It drinks really well at a young age. Cellar Door has carried it for a while and I keep coming back to it.
1153696,"Super concentrated dark fruit , great balance and soft tannins , so good it has to be declassified from main Chteau. One of best ever value in restaurant.30 euro."
1153696,"Berries on the nose, on the palate earth and raspberry with great biting acidity coming through. Tannins are there but do not overpower. This is a great Bordeaux blend, especially for the price"
1153696,Pirate red colour. Very deliscous nose. Lingonberries. These Bordeaux wines wich have most Merlot are... Very good and still there is good accidity and tannins quantaty. We like this.
1153696,"Very much enjoyed, one of the first on the exploration, dakine. Just great fruit. Hope to try more and refine thoughts. Mo betta than $50+ California wastes of money and liver."
1153696,"Quite enjoyable for a young, broad-region French wine. A bit of plum and a hint of tobacco on the palate and surprising smooth tannins. Maybe not a wow wine, but typifies qualities of French wine."
1153696," 3.75 Deep garnet/ shy nose/ dark fruit, mushroom and spicy  flavours/ medium bodied, medium+ acidity, medium+ tannins; structured/ dry.. lovely *this needs to open up but nothing a little time and an aerator couldnt fix **happy Saturday my friends  ***yay my Payton is home "
1153696,"The nose is showing a little flat, although some berry comes through. The palate is surprisingly full bodied with minerals and soil being the primary notes. The cabernet franc is lending in a little bit of a herbaceous zip on the finish. Some blackberries coming through with a long dry tannic finish. Very old world in flavour. Would be nice to revisit in a year or two when the tannins loosen their grip."
1399928,"Not a fan of sparkling wine but this is a tasty option. Dry, but not overly so. Some bubbles, but less than I've had in other sparkling wines. "
1399928,"Tart fruit character
White cherry, orange rind, green apple
Grass, apple blossom
Chalk

Solid pink with slow, incurious fine bubbles forming thin mousseaux patches along glass."
1399928,"I've had so many bottles of this and it's still a fave...bring along... When going to a friend's. 

Dry, fruity and delicious it will always be a winner especially for the price. Lots of strawberries, grapefruit and and a hint of nuttiness.

Yummy"
1399928,"Refreshing, beautiful small bubbles,flinty and full."
1399928,Laurens 30th would buy again
1399928,Toasty light yeast excellent value 
1399928,"Excellent, creamy, bright acid, floral nose. Perfect. "
1399928,For the price this was a tasty dry Cremant from the Loire
1399928,Strawberries and citrus on the nose. Dry finish.
1399928,"Nice, citrus and apple hint to it"
1380949,"Solid 3.75 stars, but not exactly what I look for in a Napa cab. Very fruit forward, lots of red berry notes and pretty sweet. But also smooth and great mouthfeel."
1380949,"Central Market tasting table - a melange of fruit flavors on this light Cabernet. Blackberries, black cherries, red cherries and even some strawberries in there. Not a typical Cabernet profile, but an enjoyable wine for what it is and the price point."
1380949,"If I were to blind taste this I would never say this was a California Cab. This almost is more like a zin or merlot, but lighter. Theres a lot of fruit in it - blueberry blackberry. I know a lot of people are saying wood or oaky tones, but not getting that."
1380949,"Not as bold as I prefer for CS but plenty flavour and smoothness. Dark cherry colour with moderate opening nose that is quite pleasing. Flavours of dark bramble type berries with hints of raspberry, mild oak and light vanilla and spice notes. Moderate tannin level and noticeable oak across the palate. Seems well balanced and quite likeable. (3.9)"
1380949,So a good wine for the price. Excellent daily wine for almost any food. Not complex and no spice to speak of. Juicy cherry / blueberry. Cheers all!
1380949,"A very good QPR on this wine but it stays on the 3.5 star side and not 4 stars mainly due to the sweetness and drying tannins on the finish.  Dark purple in color. Nose of spiced blueberries, black cherries, damp earth, pencil lead, crushed rocks. Finish of lots of sweet, tart blue and black fruit, dried herbs, minerality and dry leathery tannins.  3.7 stars. Enjoy!"
1380949,"Red fruit, cherry notes, smoke, oak, smooth, and some tannins."
1380949,"I tried this at a wine and food festival, outdoor venue, live music, not conducive to writing a tasting note...just stars."
1380949,It is ok
1380949,It grew on me as I went along
1733954,"A lovely ros sparkling wine from California that is made from 1/3 Chardonnay and 2/3 Pinot Noir and displays a pretty rich pink salmon color.

This wine produces aromas of sweet strawberries, cherry, raspberry and some apricot. 

It has pin point bubbles and a lively, zesty taste with a touch of sweetness that works well.

It is robust and well balanced on the palate with flavors of strawberry, raspberry with hints of apple and it concludes with a lasting finish.  Enjoy!"
1733954,"A very pretty pink/raspberry color.The nose is strawberry, cherry, raspberry, and hints of citrus.  The palate loses some of the strawberry but adds a bit more citrus to the cherry and raspberry.  The palate is concentrated,creamy, and has a vibrant acidity. Five stars for value.  I am a fan."
1733954,"Pink with an orange hue with plentiful tiny bubbles. Show aromas of strawberry cream, raspberry, and subtle yeast. On the palate it shows a moderately soft mousse with raspberry, strawberry and grapefruit flavors.  Good value!"
1733954,This was very fruity and delicious. A definite dessert ros but not too sweet that it was holding you back on drinking more than one glass. 
1733954,Very good nice flavors and color. Pear and apple comes through.
1733954,"Hints of yeast, tiny bubbles and just so happens to pair with a grilled seasoned pork chop heavy with a Southwestern styled dry chili powder and corn salsa."
1733954,"Grapefruit, strawberry, lime, a little yeast. Very tasty rose. Effervescence low, body medium, alcohol medium - (12.8%), acidity medium +. Solid stuff! "
1733954,"NV
Nose has Strawberry and cream.
Palate has continued strawberry and a nice crisp minerality.
A very refreshing sparkling that is perfect for summer."
1733954,"Schramsberg Brut Ros

Salmon colour in the glass. Yeasty brioche  nose. Strawberry  citrus , white tea palate. 

Goes great with California sunshine !"
1733954,"4.2 I really want to go to this winery!
This is a pretty salmon color. 
Medium nose of orange zest.
Lovely dried strawberry and orange zest on the palate.
Dry, medium body, high acidity.
"
83195,"Pale pink color. Mildly earthy nose. Medium body, quite dry, nice acidity. Apricots and raspberries on a lovely palate. Really nice! 92/100."
83195,"The one and only truly always good - Bandol domain, be it in white, ros or red! Superb ros, powerful, true wine for a meal, age worthy, only just opening. Great."
83195,Pale salmon colour. Strawberries on the nose but restrained. Dry style but with a delicate palate and lingering crisp finish. A seriously good rose !
83195,"Cant really go wrong with any Bandol Rose, but Tempier is always good. Very delicate rose gold pink color. Refreshing on the palate, it presents as a pleasant blend of green apples and peach."
83195,"This is my favorite Rose to date. Cool mix of Mourvdre, Grenache, Cinsault and Carig. White melon, rose, peach and strawberry woven together with perfect acidity and saline.  Wow."
83195,"This is an outstanding Ros. Strawberry, peach and rose.  Solid salinity. Medium body with high acidity. Served with Korean BBQ. Bottle 2 of 7 for 6 for the evening. Very limited notes because it was too fun!"
83195,"Nice classic rose! Lots of light red fruit like strawberries and raspberries, but also some fruits with more acidity like green apple and not ripe nectarines. . Well structured and spiciness in the end. I love the summer!"
83195,"Lively, but balanced. Tangy grapefruit, peach and strawberry in the opening, smooth tannins and prominent minerals in the mid. Zesty finish with a grapeseed tannin touch. Fruity nose with strawberry and peach. Medium body, balanced. Top provencal rose. 89/100"
83195,"2018 - as good as Rose gets! Pale orange in colour with an incredible nose. Layers of minerality, grapefruit citrus zest and a saline edge. The palate is lively but with a subtle acidity that relies more on the zippy nectarine finish for freshness rather than under ripeness. Simply wonderful stuff 93pts."
83195,"Best Ros Ive had? Lovely red berry nose, on the palate, some herbaceous notes- wild thyme, then more red berry, strawberry, red currant, raspberry- but just a lovely balance of acidity, a whiff of tannin and great length"
1842942,Great value for the quality. Fresh dark fruit flavors and nice earthy savoriness on the finish. Got better as it opened up. Was singing by day three (fruit day)!
1842942,"Excellent value. Definitely dry, but the image that came to mind on the first sip was blackberries drizzled with honey. Fruit forward, but a healthy backing of oak, leather, and vanilla makes this wine a complex sipper, and implies a higher price tag than what it is. Medium+ body, gentle tannins, light acid, medium length."
1842942,"A lovely dry, fruit & mineral laden Red from the Minervois region of Southern France. The name ""Les Hrtiques"" refers to the Cathars of Languedoc, a dualist religious sect that broke with the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages."
1842942,"Very good value for money! Well balanced, simple, smooth, good minerality, medium tannins, easy to pair. Honest and solid table wine "

1842942,earthy dark fruit minerals balsamic smoke acidic but juicy! Decent table wine  wouldnt have bought if not the great price.
1842942,"Dry, smooth, with rich flavour. Unbelievably light for such a tasty red..."
19265,Terrific! Raspberry and black cherry are prominent throughout. Nice smooth finish with just a hint of smokiness to round it out.
19265,"Amazing good year 2016. Wonderful, lots of aromas, full bodied, good length. Drank good also now in 2020 even if better being cellared."
19265,"Beguiling nose of cherries and plums. Good volume, persistence and acidity on the palate. Drinking well now but shows great potential. 92"
19265,"Probably the best value Barbaresco in any given year. Already delicious, this will only get better in the years to come. Viva Piemonte! Salute! "
19265,Really lovely light and dry but SO full of flavour. Lovely orange-brown colour and surprisingly aged tasting for a 2016 youre drinking in 2020
19265,Subtle and delicate. Earth and pepper and a bit of anise and dark blueberry. Tannic and acidic - complex with a long finish. Great with steak and gnocchi in a spicy marinara. Very delicious!
19265,Trying a fantastic bottle of wine  a Barbaresco from Piemonte Italy   Rose hip orange  strawberry  caramel  Have to drink more Barbaresco I really love this style of Nebbiolo wine 
19265,"Very nice and balanced, typical nebbiolo red fruit forwardness with the darkness coming in to join cherry raspberry strawberry tobacco leather oak pepper blackberry plum licorice earthy"
19265,"Needs significant air. 3hr decant then poured back into the bottle and left in the wine fridge overnight. The next day, you can really see this Wines aging potential.  Abundant ripe strawberries, raspberries, very floral, some earthy too, tobacco, and plenty of firm tannins to last for decades."
19265,"The 2016 vintage of this wine is truly great and one of the best Ive tried from Produttori del Barbaresco including many of their amazing single vineyard riservas. Bright acidity that needs to settle a bit, mild tannins that still provides an excellent structure lingers underneath the beautiful dark cherry fruit, just a hint of licorice on the finish thats long and rich. Very elegant and stringent with everything in the right place. It actually reminds me of the fantastic 2011 Asili riserva. Wow."
1944048,"Floral and subtle red fruit notes, very nice landing and first contact, light body with good balance and follow through, it drinks well and feels right. Great value Pinot Noir!"
1944048,"Nice value. On initial review appeared to be light and would have rated a 3.5, but after time really opened up well. Nice fruit balance. Nice berries on the nose. Easy drinking."
1944048,"Sour cherry and raspberry on the nose with light mushroom and dried good earthiness and delicate wood influence - neutral oak. Smooth and incredibly easy-going palate of sour cherry, and a little vanilla, which reminds me of some soda. Medium acidity, light plus grippy tannin, and medium minor body. Very fruit-forward yet genuinely light with well balanced attributes that's delightful to drink."
1944048,Also surprised this is not rated higher I thought this had pretty good balance a ton of red fruit and a little vanilla.
1944048,Would buy it again. Good value
1944048,Fantastic value. M- body. Tart red fruit and citrus surprisingly.
1944048,"Red fruit, raspberry and cherry abound. I like my pinots to be slightly spicy. This wasn't that. Yummy, but not what I expected."
1944048,Fruit forward everyday Pinot.
1944048,"You know I thought this wine would be mediocre but no, its pretty damn good. Thats all."
1944048,"Amazing nose. Some earthy notes, with mushroom, and cola, some red fruit like raspberry and strawberry. Maybe a touch of cocoa and vanilla. On the palette some cranberry, strawberry, and light leather, along with some of the earthy notes. I wish it tasted as good as it smelled. Tannins are ok, acidity is ok. Amazing for $12. Very enjoyable cali pinot. Would guess OR."
15615,"Couldn't figure out how old it is, but we had to guess 20 years or more. Stunning wine. Super complex and constantly evolving. Great bubble."
15615,Very impressive. A perfect harmony of fruit and autolytic notes. Lots of toasty biscuit. And the bubbles are really well integrated. A class apart. Enjoy!
15615,"SURPRISE WINE PICNIC FOR MY GIRL ! Yep, Mau is back! I couldn't be more happy, and this was her first surprise fresh off the plane! I took her to Gold Medal Park in downtown Minneapolis. Beautiful views! Euphoric bubbles! My island queen! Nothing further needed! So impressive, this bottle impressed with fine mousse that didn't offend, complementing the cheeses & such perfectly. Floral notes with flavors of citrus, apple & pear. We oo'd & ah'd with every sip! A definite rebuy!"
15615,"Always a solid performer. The nose was fresh with some green apple and a hint of Brazil nut. It is the palate of this wine though that delights. Creamy, elegant and beautiful length. Clean and crisp. Love it."
15615,"4.3 I am always smiling when drinking this excellent Brut .  Balanced vibrancy, ultra fine beads that unfurl the subtle brioche, crisp apple and juicy lemon core while remaining elegant and persistent. Complete champagne. @Parc Broekhuizen"
15615,"Celebrating good news w. my Dad, better half & kids. Dad reckons this was bought 20+ yrs ago in Reims but I cant find out when the label dates from. Med lemon w. lazy fine bubbles. Caramelised pineapple, baked lemon, toast, brioche, orange blossom & citrus biscuits. Vanilla custard & cream w. a touch of honeysuckle & butterscotch. Fully developed. Just off-dry. Honey, patisserie, peach stone, red apple & lemon peel. Med alc, a creamy mousse & a long complex finish w. brioche, nutty cream & vanilla. Yum!"
15615,"A PICNIC SURPRISE How lucky am I when I get a picnic surprise straight from my flight? Very. And when that surprise includes this bubbly AND proper glassware? Even more so! There is an elegant depth to this Champagne, a restrained touch that that makes you lean in, a soft unfolding reminiscent of a bud opening at the break of dawn. There are summer apples & lemon hints, bakery nuances & a wash of saline. As its' essence wraps me in a happy bubble, I take Scott's hand & THAT was the perfect finish.:)"
15615,"This Champagne never disappoints! Quince and Tangerine on nose and palate, but with such a wonderful mousse like mouthfeel. This is about elegance and freshness intertwined. In my view this producer distinguishes itself because their terroir is located in Marne subsection of Champagne which is best suited for red grapes of Pinot Noir and Pinot Muenier, which not by happenstance comprises 70% of their blend. In my Sushi/Sake night, this was my WOTN. Guess it just hard to pull me away from a good bottle of wine."
15615,"Smooth, complex fizz. Biscuit nose. Lemon and green apple. Tart, with a hint of sweetness in the full body that then turns to high acidity."
15615,"Nose is an excellent tropical like pineapple, fresh apple. Medium bubbles. Taste is very crisp, pleasant lemon and apple notes."
1209439,"More complex you might expect for a pinot. Full palate of red berries (cherry, strawberry, cranberry) underlined with earthy notes and oak hints."
1209439,"Cherry and tobacco on the nose, raspberry and blackberry on the tongue, nice clean finish. If this is what comes from the San Andreas Fault, bring it on!"
1209439,"Top Pinot noir from Hirsch. Wonderful Pinot nose of herbs, spice, earth and fruit. Balanced on the palate with plenty of complex notes on the finish ."
1209439,"Lovey nose of wild strawberries, leather and black pepper. Juicy with a dry finish. Palate follows the nose. Complex and balanced. On par with a high quality Burgundy Pinot Noir"
1209439,"Outstanding. This wine says hello! Fruit is solid. Acidity is there. Strawberry, roses, raspberry, Hirsch Vineyards has made another great wine out of Sonoma. Easy to drink."
1209439,4.4: well balanced Pinot with great structure. Red fruit forward with strawberry notes shining through. Subtle tertiary underlying notes with a medium finish. Great wine
1209439,"Medium ruby colour. A floral and perfumes nose with lavender and violets. Medium (+) acid and medium (+) silky tannins. Medium (+) flavour intensity with raspberry, violets, red cherry and cedar notes. Medium finish"
1209439,"Ripe strawberry dominates the palate up front, then it progresses to a lightly spicy cedar finish. Vibrant red berry notes with a smooth mouthfeel. It paired well with lamb lollipops at the wine tasting event. 6.21.18"
1209439,"San Andreas Fault is the signature wine of Hirsch. Grapes are from 5 clones planted at 30 positions and hence represent the estate. Stored 17 months on french oak which 35% is new. It is non filtered and not cleared Style is cold climate PN with excellent balance between fruit and acidity. Palette is strawberry, raspberry, cranberries hints of liquorice. Medium finish. Well done! "
1209439,"Smokier than most Sonoma Pinots - light ABV but cherry, pepper, and that hint of smoke. Excellent especially 15% off at Astor."
