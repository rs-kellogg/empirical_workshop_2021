CONFIRMING STATEMENT

This Confirming Statement ("Statement") confirms that the undersigned, Seth
Rasmussen, pursuant to his power and authority in his role as attorney-in-fact
for Stephanie Zapata Moore ("Reporting Person") granted by that certain Power of
Attorney entered into as of May 28, 2019 ("Power of Attorney"), hereby
authorizes, directs and designates Yuki Whitmire ("Designee"), acting singly,
to: (1) prepare, execute in the Reporting Person's name and on the Reporting
Person's behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other documents
necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned
to make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") or any rule or regulation
of the SEC; (2) execute for and on behalf of the Reporting Person, in the
Reporting Person's capacity as an officer and/or director of Vistra Corp. (the
"Company"), Forms 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
and the rules thereunder; (3) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf
of the Reporting Person which may be necessary or desirable to complete and
execute any such Form 4 or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto, and timely file such form with the SEC and any stock exchange or
similar authority; and (4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in
connection with the foregoing which, in the opinion of the Designee, may be of,
benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the Reporting
Person, it being understood that the documents executed by the Designee on
behalf of the Reporting Person pursuant to this Statement shall be in such form
and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Designee may approve in the
Designee's discretion.

The undersigned, pursuant to his power and authority in his role as
attorney-in-fact for the Reporting Person, hereby grants to the Designee full
power and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary, or property to be done in the exercise of any of the
rights and powers granted under this Statement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as the Reporting Person might or that the Designee, or the Designee's
substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of
this Statement and the rights and powers herein granted. On behalf of the
Reporting Person, the undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing Designee, in
serving in such capacity on behalf of the Reporting Person, is not assuming, nor
is the Company assuming, any of the Reporting Person's responsibilities to
comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

The authority of the Designee under this Statement shall continue until the
Reporting Person is no longer required to file Forms 4 and 5 with respect to the
Reporting Person's holdings of and/or transactions in securities of the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the Reporting Person, or any attorney-in-fact, in a
signed writing delivered to the Designee.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Statement to be executed as
of this 6th day of October, 2020.

By: /s/ Seth Rasmussen, as attorney-in-fact for Stephanie Zapata Moore
